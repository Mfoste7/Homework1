# Square, In.c (NYSE:SQ)

## Overview

Square, Inc. was formed in February 2009 by [Jack Dorsey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Dorsey) and [Jim McKelvey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_McKelvey). Square is a leading provider of payment processing, point-of-sale (POS), financial, and marketing services for [microenterprise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro-enterprise), [small and mid-sized](https://www.sba.gov/federal-contracting/contracting-guide/size-standards) merchants that work to democratize commerce by facilitating the equitible treatment of transactions by merchants of all sizes. Square additionlly has financial services products that aim to allow individuals (as opposed to enterprises) manage their money. The company generates the majority of its revenue from US based payments and POS services.

 ## Origin
 
 As with many disrupting technologies throughout history, the inspiration for Square was incepted by the need for  a practical solution for a problem faced by a otherwise comman man. Jim McKelvey was a St. Louis based glass blower that specialized in hand-crafting high-end faucets and fittings.<sup>1</sup> As one might expect of true artisan with a passion for his craft, McKelvey didn't want to concern himself with the technical challenges of accepting credit card payments, and originally only accepted cash from his customers. However, as some of his higher priced designs would price well into the thousands of dollars, he was losing material sales potential purely due to the perceived challenges of implementing a meching through which he could accept credit card payments.

 As fate would have it, McKelvey relayed his dilemma to his close friend: a young Jack Dorsey. The two endevoured to find a way for small McKelvey, and other small businesses, to begin accepting credit card payments without paying exhorbitant fees. In the advent of universality of smart phones in the United States, the two determined that they could 'cut out the middle' man and bring the card swiping business into the mobile phone era.<sup>2</sup>

>  "So we took a month and we built a prototype,” Dorsey says. The cofounders showed it at the Allen & Company conference in 2009, and received backing from Khosla Ventures not long after.<sup>2</sup>

Following the conference, Vinod Khosla's Kholsa Ventures led a $10 million Series A round at a $40 million 'post-money' valuation. Kholsa was clearly impressed by what he heard at the Allen and Company conference, as Square had yet to even introduce its now hallmark square-shaped credit card readers to the public. His confidence in the pair paid off. When Square launched its Initial Public Offering at $9 per share in November 2015, Kholsa Ventures investment was worth nearly $500 million.<sup>3</sup>

## Context for Disruption: A Credit Card Processing Primer

Prior to the payment processing evolution of which Square was foundational, a typical merchant could only accept credit card transactions after engaging an [Independent Sales Organization (ISO)](https://www.tsys.com/news-innovation/whats-new/Articles-and-Blogs/Industry-Insights/Merchant/2019/payments-101-what-is-an-iso.aspx). An ISO, generally speaking, is a third party contracted by major credit card companies - Amex, Discover, Visa, Mastercard, etc. - to procure new merchant relationships. The problem that faced McKelvey and other proprietors was that these ISO contracts came at a significant cost. They must pay for the credit card reader, a monthly fee, and a gateway fee. And that is before the fees charged by the credit card companies. Rates can be as low as 1.79%, with wards cost running as high as 4%. So for your average merchant processing credit cards, they receive a monthly remittence that reduces their sales for all the aforementioned fees, net of any disputed charges. These credit card fees, and particularly the chargebacks, can vary significantly, and in your average convenience store that sells low margin products and are paying likely paying a significant proportion of their cashflow in the form of fixed rent, in addition to the extraordinarily high cost of accepting credit card payments under the ISO model, they are unable to accurately forecast their cashflow month to month. According to the report by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, of the 30 million businesses in the States with gross receipts of under $100 thousand, only 6 million accept credit cards.

When Square launched it's card reader in 2011, each transaction is was priced at 2.75% plus $0.15. Not the lowest credit card fee in the market by any means, but by disintermediating the ISO, its offering provided merchants a consistent and reliable mechanism to process credit card transactions, regardless of card type.<sup>2</sup>


## Square Today:

After launching its square mobile phone or tablet based card reader (Square Reader) in 2010, Square has changed much as a company. Research analysts articulate Square's operations as being two distinct ecosystems operates two distinct operating ecosystems:

 **1) Seller** 

 The Seller ecosystem includes the foundational disrupting technology referenced above, but Square management has expanded its legacy business to include a suite of bank-like services beyond transaction processsing. These include Square Card (operates like a debit card), small buisness lending, inventory management solutions, integrated payroll processing, employee benefits, marketing, and analytics to further penetrate and monetize existing Square customer relationships. The below chart taken from the RBC equity research analyst note on 10/15/20 provides a comprehensive view of the totality of of the Seller ecosystem:

 While analysts and investors feared that seller ecosystem results would stagnate due to the impact of the pandemic on the retail sector, its recent results proved Seller to maintain resilient installed base. Seller represented $3.5 billion and $1.4 billion of revenue and gross profit, respctively, in FY19, and RBC's 10/15/20 note<sup>4</sup> estimates FY20 Seller revenue to be a similar $3.5 million, with slightly lower gross profit of $1.1 million. 

 Given the economic consequences of the pandemic to the retail sector during the past 6 months, Seller's forecasted stable revenue YoY represents a truely remarkable achievement, both in terms of market penetration, as well as successful cross-selling of new financial services to existing clients. Seller ecosystem revenue represented 85.3% of FY19 revenue, as it represents an the culmination of a meticulous expansion of its original disrupting technology. However, while Square is expected remain predominantly predicated on the Seller ecosystem, the Cash App division represents the true growth story. RBC estimates that Seller ecosystem revenue will fall to 72.9% of Square revenues in FY20, and ultimately to 62.8% in FY22. With overall combined ecosystem revenue expected to increase from $4.9 billion in FY19 to 8.6 billion in FY22$4.9 billion in FY19 to 8.6 billion in FY22. While the Seller ecosystem will remain the heart of Square for the foreseeable future, clearly the constructive thesis and growth story centers around Cash App.


**2) Cash App**

In March 2018, Square launched a mobile application Square Cash for businesses, which includes the ability of individuals, organizations, and business owners to use a unique username (a 'cashtag', which is a unique username preceded by '$"). Ignoring its newly launched ability to provide users a simplified equity and crypto brokerage capacity, this product was not necessarily novel at the time, and had myriad competitors, including PayPayl (NYSE: PYPL), Venmo (a stopgap intermediary solution for traditional banks threatened by the emerging P2P sector), and othersIn this reveolutionary move for the company, it evolved from purely a disrupter of the traditional ISO merchant credit card processing model, to one that participated in the highly competitive peer-to-peer (P2P) payment processing service. It is now known under the brand Cash App. The service allows users to request and transfer money to another Cash App user. In addition, users can entroll an a free debit card called the Cash Card. But most revolutionary is the Cash App's ability to allow users to purchase publicly traded equities, ETF's, and cyroptocurrencies (currently only Bitcoin is available). In FY19, Cash App accounted for only $1.4 billion in revenue, representing only 14.7% of Square Revenue, analysts<sup>4</sup>, it did so at an 83% gross margin. However, Square is expected by RBC to grow to 41.2% and 44.8% of gross margin in FY22.

The monetization and fee structure of Cash App is perhaps the salient element to understand about the future of Square. The primary fee channels<sup>5</sup> of Cash App are as follows

**a) Instant Withdrawl**
        A small share of users will use their “instant withdrawal” feature to deposit their Cash App balance directly to their regular checking account, “instant withdrawal has a 1.5% fee.

 **b) Credit Card Funded P2P Payments**
        A small share of users will fund their P2P transfers to friends through their credit card (vs. debit card/bank account), which has a 3% fee.

**c) Interchange Fee on Cash Card Payments**
        You can order a “Cash Card”, which is a debit card using your Cash App balance. Every time you use this Cash Card to pay at a merchant (let’s say a local grocery store or an online purchase), Cash App receives ~1.5% of the transaction price from the merchant. That’s the interchange fee they receive as the issuing bank of the debit card.
**d) Bitcoin Net Margin**
        Cash App makes around 1% to 2% on all Bitcoin trades. E.g. you buy Bitcoin from them for $100, buy they bought it themselves for $99, so they get a $1 spread (1% of your trading volume).
**e) Interest on Cash App Balances**
        They can invest some of the Cash App balances into money market accounts and maybe get around 1% of interest on it.

A similar visual of the Cash App ecosystem is useful from teh recent RBC analyst update:

![RBC Cash App Ecosystem](./cashappecosystem.png)

While all 5 of these fee sources are inherently scaleable at significant operating leverage, it is separated from its primary competitors from wildly successful adoption of cryptocurrency (via Bitcoin) and appeals to consumers who prefer to transact in anonymity via the deatures of blockchain technology. In evidence of this deliberate and strategic move to distinguish itself, Square recently made an open purchase of $50 million in Bitcoin, demonstrating support for the contentious asset class / currency as a Corporation<sup>6</sup>

The total addressable market is any active consumer with access to a smartphone and/or the, internet. As such, there are several formidable opponents vying for share. However, Cash App's open embracing of blockchain as a mechanism for the anonymous transfer of value, has buttressed its appeal to a growing class of young, technologgicaly savy (and thus privacy sensitive) consumers.

But perhaps the most important distinguishing characteristic, which until today would have been my primary reccomendation for the company, was making its Square Terminal API, which is a truly transformative decision. As stated in Yahoo Finance article dated 10/19/20, which stated:

> "The tool allows connection of all-in-one card payments device, Square Terminal with the developers’ POS, ERP or practice management system, thus, helping them to developcustom-built kiosk for ordering and checkout, medical practice management system to synchronize patient data, andpayments solution among otherbusiness management software with contactless feature in them.

Moreover, this tool works irrespective of operating systems and platforms on which developers have built their POS, ERP and practice management system, which, in turn, will deliver flexibility to developers, while creating business software.<sup>7</sup>

In summary, Square continues to innovate in ways that make its larger, more conventional competitors grasping for answers. Jack and his team will dream for the sake of dreaming, and while I am personally horrified by his inability to effectively monetize Twitter adervitisments and cotain mass, cultrurally destructive information, I believe Square, via the Cash App ecosystem, will prevail against all odds.
